ðŸš€ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
cd <your-repo-name>
2. Initialize npm (if not already initialized)
If you don't see a package.json file inside your project, run:


npm init -y
This will quickly create a package.json file with default values.

3. Install Cypress
Install Cypress as a development dependency:

npm install cypress --save-dev
After this, you should see cypress listed under devDependencies in your package.json.

ðŸ§ª How to Run Cypress Tests
You have two options to run tests:

Option 1: Open Cypress Test Runner (Interactive Mode)

npx cypress open
This will launch the Cypress Test Runner window.

Select the test spec files you want to execute.

Option 2: Run Tests in Headless Mode (Terminal)

npx cypress run
Runs tests without opening a browser window.

Useful for automated pipelines like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
